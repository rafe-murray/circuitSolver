# Circuit Solver

Solve arbitrary circuits for their voltages and currents. This project is currently still in development, so the code will not be working yet.

## Running the Code

Note: these instructions are for unix-based machines; no guarantees are made that they will work on windows.
Clone the repo on your local machine

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rafe-murray/circuitSolver.git
```

Then compile the source code

```bash
cd circuitSolver
make solver
```

Finally, run the compiled executable

```bash
./solver
```
