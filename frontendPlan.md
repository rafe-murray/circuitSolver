# Plan

- Use [diagram.js](https://github.com/bpmn-io/diagram-js) to develop a custom circuit editor - see [here](https://github.com/apache/incubator-seata/tree/2.x/saga/seata-saga-statemachine-designer) for better docs
- Add keyboard shortcuts for different components
- Add node-gyp wrapper for c++ code to use it as a node.js module
- Use cmake.js instead - easier compilation because it copies the syntax of cmake and ceres is built with cmake
- Base the ux on [https://www.falstad.com/circuit/circuitjs.html](https://www.falstad.com/circuit/circuitjs.html)
